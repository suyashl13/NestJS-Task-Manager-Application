# NestJS Task Manager Application

## Description

Create a simple Task Manager application using NestJS where users can manage their tasks. This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with NestJS concepts and features.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can register, log in, and log out.
   - JWT (JSON Web Token) is implemented for secure authentication.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Authenticated users can perform CRUD operations on tasks.
   - Tasks have a title, description, due date, and status.

3. **Authorization:**
   - Users can only manipulate their own tasks.
   - Role-based access control (regular user vs. admin) is implemented.

4. **Task Categories:**
   - Users can categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping).

5. **Search and Filter:**
   - Search tasks based on title or description.
   - Filter tasks based on status, due date, or category.

6. **Pagination:**
   - Implement pagination for improved performance.

7. **WebSocket Integration:**
   - Real-time updates using WebSocket for added, updated, or deleted tasks.

8. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests and integration tests for robust application testing.

9. **Logging and Error Handling:**
   - Logging records important events in the application.
   - Centralized error handling mechanism.

10. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the NestJS application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud).
